## User spec

### Receipt scanning

As a user, you'll be able to create a new "bill split", to which you invite Facebook friends, and/or additional people via Bluetooth/NFC/Wi-Fi.

You scan one or more receipt(s) with your phone camera and choose the payment options. There are two options:
- the users split the cost equally among themselves (splitting bill evenly/treating someone to a meal)
- each person pays for their own items (going Dutch)

In the "split evenly" case, the paying users select their preferred tip percentage; the final tip percentage is averaged from these.

In the "each their own" case, each receipt gets converted to a list of checkboxes (one per receipt item). Every user can tick the checkboxes corresponding to items they've ordered to figure out their total. Users can also select their preferred tip percentage, which gets added to their subtotal.

Once payment has been set up, the program calculates the total due (items + tips) and allows the paying users to choose how to pay:
- amount in cash
- amount in card
- amount in PaySafe
- ask someone else to cover all/part of your bill; the application will track such dues in the future
- call someone's due

People who pay cash have an option that helps them find exact change (TODO).

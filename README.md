## User spec

### Receipt scanning

As a user, you'll be able to create a new "bill split", to which you can invite your Facebook friends, or additional people via Bluetooth/NFC/WiFi.

You scan one or more receipt(s) with your phone camera and choose the payment options. There are two options:
- the users split the cost equally among themselves (splitting bill evenly/giving a treat)
- each person pays for their own items (going Dutch)

In the "split evenly" case, the paying users select their tip percentage.

In the "each their own" case, each receipt gets converted to a list of checkboxes (one per receipt item). Every user can tick the checkboxes corresponding to items they've ordered to figure out their total. Users can also select their preferred tip percentage.

Once payment has been set up, the program calculates the total due and allows the paying users to choose how to pay:
- amount in cash
- amount in card
- amount in PaySafe
- ask someone else to cover all/part of your bill
